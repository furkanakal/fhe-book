# Ideal Lattices and Ring-LWE

Ideal lattices form the backbone of Ring-LWE, a variant of the LWE problem that operates within the structure of polynomial rings. This adaptation provides a more efficient framework for cryptographic applications by leveraging the algebraic properties of rings (we're about to discuss). Ideal lattices are characterized by their basis, derived from ideals in polynomial rings, which enables the construction of cryptographic schemes that are both secure and efficient. The introduction of Ring-LWE marks a significant advancement in cryptographic techniques, offering a practical approach to securing information in the face of evolving computational capabilities.

## Rings and Ideals

### Rings
A **ring** is a set \\( R \\) equipped with two binary operations, addition \\( + \\) and multiplication \\( \cdot \\), satisfying the following three sets of axioms, called the **ring axioms**:

- \\( R \\) is an **abelian group** under addition, meaning:
  - \\( (a + b) + c = a + (b + c) \\) for all \\( a, b, c \in R \\) (associativity of addition).
  - \\( a + b = b + a \\) for all \\( a, b \in R \\) (commutativity of addition).
  - There exists an element \\( 0 \in R \\) such that \\( a + 0 = a \\) for all \\( a \in R \\) (additive identity).
  - For each \\( a \in R \\), there exists \\( -a \in R \\) such that \\( a + (-a) = 0 \\) (additive inverse).

- \\( R \\) is a **monoid** under multiplication, meaning:
  - \\( (a \cdot b) \cdot c = a \cdot (b \cdot c) \\) for all \\( a, b, c \in R \\) (associativity of multiplication).
  - There exists an element \\( 1 \in R \\) such that \\( a \cdot 1 = a \\) and \\( 1 \cdot a = a \\) for all \\( a \in R \\) (multiplicative identity).

- Multiplication is **distributive** over addition:
  - \\( a \cdot (b + c) = (a \cdot b) + (a \cdot c) \\) for all \\( a, b, c \in R \\) (left distributivity).
  - \\( (b + c) \cdot a = (b \cdot a) + (c \cdot a) \\) for all \\( a, b, c \in R \\) (right distributivity).

Rings appear in various areas of mathematics and computer science, particularly in algebraic structures and their applications. Their flexibility extends arithmetic operations from integers and real numbers to more complex entities like polynomials, matrices, and functions. This adaptability proves especially useful in cryptography, where ring structures facilitate the design of secure and efficient cryptographic protocols.

### Ideals
For a ring \\( R \\), let \\( R^+ \\) denote its additive group. A subset \\( I \subseteq R \\) is called a **left ideal** of \\( R \\) if:

- \\( I \\) is a subgroup of \\( R^+ \\).
- For all \\( r \in R \\) and \\( i \in I \\), we have \\( r \cdot i \in I \\).

In cryptographic contexts, particularly in lattice-based and Ring-LWE-based schemes, ideals play a fundamental role in defining the structure of cryptographic systems. The use of ideals enables properties such as homomorphism, allowing operations on encrypted data without decryption. This property is particularly valuable in secure multi-party computation and homomorphic encryption. Furthermore, the mathematical properties of ideals contribute to both the efficiency and security of cryptographic constructions, including resistance to quantum attacks.

## What Is an Ideal Lattice?
An **ideal lattice** is an integer lattice \\( L \\) such that:

\\[
L = \{ f(a) \mid a \in I \},
\\]

for some monic polynomial \\( f \\) of degree \\( n \\) and ideal \\( I \\) in a ring.

More generally, ideal lattices correspond to ideals in rings of the form:

\\[
R = \mathbb{Z}[x]/(f(x)),
\\]

where \\( f(x) \\) is an irreducible polynomial of degree \\( n \\).
