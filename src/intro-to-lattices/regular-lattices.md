# Definition and Properties

## Definition
A **lattice** \\( L \\) is generated by a set of linearly independent vectors and consists of all integer linear combinations of these basis vectors. Formally, we define:

\\[ L = \{ \sum_{i=1}^{n} c_i b_i \mid c_i \in \mathbb{Z} \}, \\]

where \\( \{b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n\} \\) is a set of basis vectors.

### Notes
- The integers \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) represent the **dimension** and **rank** of the lattice, respectively.
- If \\( m = n \\), the lattice \\( L \\) is termed a **full-rank lattice**.

### Unimodular Matrices
An integer matrix \\( A \\) is called **unimodular** if it has an inverse that is also an integer matrix, meaning \\( A^{-1} \in \mathbb{Z}^{n \times n} \\).

### Equivalent Bases
If \\( B \\) and \\( B' \\) are two different basis matrices for the same lattice \\( L \\), then they satisfy the relationship:

\\[ B' = B A, \\]

where \\( A \\) is a unimodular matrix.
