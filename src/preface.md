# Preface

Welcome to **The FHE Book**, a comprehensive guide to Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE). This book is designed to be a starting point for anyone interested in understanding one of the most exciting areas in modern cryptography. Whether you're a student, researcher, developer, or simply someone curious about the field, this book will take you on a journey through the foundations of cryptography, the mathematics behind FHE, and its practical implementations.

In recent years, FHE has gained significant attention for its potential to revolutionize data privacy and security. By enabling computations on encrypted data without the need for decryption, FHE offers a way to process sensitive information securely and privately. This breakthrough has far-reaching implications for industries such as healthcare, finance, and cloud computing, as well as for emerging technologies like blockchain and machine learning.

The structure of this book reflects the progression of ideas that led to the development of FHE:

- We begin with **basic cryptographic concepts**, laying the groundwork for understanding how encryption works and its different forms.
- The **historical review** takes you through early attempts at secure computation, such as privacy homomorphisms, which paved the way for FHE.
- Next, we discuss the mathematical foundations with an **introduction to lattices** and the **Learning-with-Errors (LWE)** problem, both of which are critical to understanding modern FHE schemes.
- The book then transitions to the **pre-FHE era**, exploring foundational cryptosystems like Paillier's scheme, before discussing **Craig Gentry’s groundbreaking work** that made FHE practical.
- From there, we dive deep into specific FHE schemes such as **BFV, BGV, CKKS**, and **TFHE**, explaining their mechanics, strengths, and limitations.
- Finally, we explore **real-world implementations**, the **companies driving innovation in FHE**, and its **use cases** across various domains.

Throughout the book, we emphasize clarity and accessibility. Complex topics are broken down step by step, with examples and diagrams to aid understanding. While we strive for precision, this book is not an academic text—it is a pedagogical resource aimed at making FHE approachable to learners of all backgrounds.

A word of caution: The code snippets and examples provided in this book are for educational purposes only. They are not intended for production use and may lack the optimizations and security measures required in real-world applications.

Cryptography is a rapidly evolving field, and Fully Homomorphic Encryption is at its frontier. By reading this book, you are joining a growing community of innovators and researchers pushing the boundaries of what is possible with secure computation.

Let’s embark on this journey to demystify Fully Homomorphic Encryption and unlock its potential together.
